The Materials and their Mechanical Properties Lab investigates the stress/strain of wire in order for students to measure
Young's Modulus. The assembly was designed to emmulate current wire stretching/testing apparatus using a fixed capstan afixed to a load
cell, and a movable capstan to provide a pulling force. The movable capstan is also connected to a linear potentiometer via pulleys to 
obtain a distance moved from voltage readouts (see picture for setup).

A .STP/.STEP file of the assembly is provided for use.

The base assembly is from Openbuilds and is their 500 mm C-Beam Linear Actuator Bundle:

All components with a series of numbers/letters after them are from McMaster-Carr (McMaster.com). The numbers/letters are the McMaster
part number.

The Linear Potentiometer used is from Digi-Key Electronics:
