The Structural Systems Lab is designed to allow students to measure beam bending properties with load.
A metal strip (0.75" wide x 36" long) is placed on top of moveable platforms. These platforms allow students
to investigate different support distances. Additionally, the platforms are able to be positioned so the
metal strip is supported at only one end. Students hang weights on the bar and measure the amount the bar bends
using either the dial indicator on the top bar, or with a rulers. The current assembly can accept both
1/8" and 3/16" thick metal strips.


Future plans:
We noticed that the spring of the dial indicator put enough force on the metal strip to cause it to bed.
We removed the spring and still had the same problem. We are looking into ways to get a contactless deflection
measurement accurate to at least 0.001". Once a solution has been designed and tested, we plan to update the
files here.
