The precision measurement lab was designed to teach students how to use tools often used in industry and research settings.
Students went over the use of rulers, tape measures, vernier calipers, digital calipers, micrometers, dial indicators, etc.
Students used machinist's squares and gauge blocks.

An assembly to measure thread pitch was created.
This assembly used 80/20 material as the base structure which allowed the use of a slide to move a dial indicator side-to-side.
Students positioned the dial indicator at screws in a block assembly. The screws would then be turned, pushing on the dial indicator
to allow them to see how much the screw moves with each revolution.
