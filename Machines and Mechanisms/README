The Machines and Mechanisms Lab investigates gear ratios, speed reduction, and change of direction designs.
An 18:1 worm gear assembly was designed and built. A window was cut into the side plates to allow better
visualization of the gears. Students were then able to look at speed reduction.


Future plans:
Torque multiplcation was attempted to be measured, however this is not the designed funciton of a worm gear
assembly. Another type of gear design will be invesitaged and planned to be added to the next occurance of
the lab. We plan to upload files here when a design is tested.
